## Description
 This is my personal portfolio displaying projects I've created, my skills, a link to my resume  and a contact form to get in touch with me. There are also links to some of my social media profiles including LinkedIn, GitHub and others.
 This portfolio is a single-page-application (SPA) that was created using React. CSS features such as flexbox and grid were used, and [FontAwesome for React](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react) React component library was also used for brand icons of links to my social media accounts.
